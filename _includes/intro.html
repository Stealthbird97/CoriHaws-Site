    <p>Welcome to my online portfolio.</p>
    <p>I'm not one for creative writing so you won't find much of that here, instead you'll find vaguely important information about me. This website is part of an ongoing project undertaken as an aid to my HTML, Linux, and web-server knowledge.</p>
    <p>This site has been built using the static site generator, Jekyll, using the twitter Bootstrap framework for CSS.</p>
